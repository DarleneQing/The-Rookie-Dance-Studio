## Booking Classes

### How do I book a dance class?

1. Log in to your account
2. Navigate to the "Courses" page
3. Browse upcoming classes
4. Click "Book Now" on your desired class
5. Review the class details and important rules
6. Confirm your booking

You'll be booked either as a single class or using your active subscription (if you have one).

### What's the difference between single class booking and subscription booking?

- **Single Class Booking**: Pay per class (CHF 10 for students, CHF 15 for adults). No subscription required.
- **Subscription Booking**: If you have an active subscription (Monthly, 5-Times, or 10-Times card), your booking will automatically use your subscription credits.

### What subscription options are available?

We offer three subscription types:

1. **Monthly Card**: Unlimited classes for 30 days from your selected start date
2. **5-Times Card**: Valid for 5 class check-ins with no expiration date
3. **10-Times Card**: Valid for 10 class check-ins with no expiration date

Subscriptions are assigned by administrators. Contact us at therookiestudio.ch@gmail.com to purchase a subscription.

### Can I have multiple subscriptions at the same time?

No, only one active subscription is permitted per user at any time. Once your current subscription expires or is fully used, you can purchase a new one.

### What happens if a class is full?

Classes have a maximum capacity. If a class shows "FULL", you cannot book it. We recommend booking early to secure your spot. You can check the "Courses" page regularly for new classes or cancellations that free up spots.

### Can I see which classes I've booked?

Yes! On the "Courses" page, switch to the "My Bookings" tab to see all your upcoming booked classes. You can also view your complete course history on your Profile page under "Course History".

---

## Cancellations and Changes

### Can I cancel my booking?

Yes, but timing matters:
- **Free cancellation**: Cancel up to 24 hours before the class start time
- **Late cancellation**: Cancellations within 24 hours of the class start time result in forfeiture of the full contribution fee or subscription credit

### How do I cancel a booking?

1. Go to the "Courses" page
2. Switch to the "My Bookings" tab
3. Find the class you want to cancel
4. Click "Cancel Booking"
5. Confirm the cancellation

If the "Cancel Booking" button is disabled, you're within the 24-hour window and cannot cancel without penalty.

### What happens if the studio cancels a class?

If The Rookie Dance Studio cancels a class due to instructor unavailability, insufficient enrollment, venue issues, or force majeure events, you can choose between:
- Credit toward future classes
- Full refund of the paid fee

Refunds are processed within 14 business days.

### Can I transfer my booking to another person?

No, bookings are non-transferable. Each participant must have their own account and book classes individually.

## Check-in and Attendance

### How does the QR code check-in work?

1. When you arrive at class, open your Profile page
2. Tap on "SHOW MEMBER QR" (the purple card at the top)
3. Present your QR code to the instructor or admin
4. They will scan it to check you in
5. Your attendance is recorded, and subscription credits are deducted (if applicable)

### Where can I find my QR code?

Your personal QR code is on your Profile page. Tap the purple "SHOW MEMBER QR" card to display it in full-screen mode for easy scanning.

### What if I forget to check in?

Check-in is required for attendance validation. If you forget to check in:
- Your attendance won't be recorded
- Your subscription credit won't be deducted
- You may not receive credit for the class

Always check in when you arrive!

### Can I check in multiple times for the same class?

Yes, the system allows duplicate check-ins for the same course. However, only one check-in per class is necessary. Multiple check-ins won't deduct additional credits.

### What if I booked a class but can't attend?

Cancel your booking as soon as possible (ideally more than 24 hours before the class). If you don't cancel and don't attend, you'll forfeit your contribution fee or subscription credit.
